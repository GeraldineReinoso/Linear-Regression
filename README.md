# Linear Regression

This notebook applies Simple Univariate Linear Regression to fit a straight line through given data points. The method models the relationship between an input variable X and an output variable Y by identifying the best-fitting line. Using Gradient Descent, the parameters Î¸0 and Î¸1 are iteratively updated from an initial value of zero to minimize the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE). The optimization continues until the SSE drops below 0.5, ensuring the resulting line provides a close fit to the observed data.
